REQP-1839#15 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 design_2_i/effect/AXI_pitch_shift_0/inst/cb1/mem_reg has an input control pin design_2_i/effect/AXI_pitch_shift_0/inst/cb1/mem_reg/ADDRBWRADDR[14] (net: design_2_i/effect/AXI_pitch_shift_0/inst/cb1/ADDRBWRADDR[9]) which is driven by a register (design_2_i/effect/AXI_pitch_shift_0/inst/cb1_read_addr_reg[9]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
